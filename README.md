## Features

- **Game logic**: handles card dealing, level progression, lives, and throwing stars (as in the original game).  
- **Turn management**: enforces playing cards in order without explicit communication.  
- **Multi-round progression**: levels get harder as players advance.  
- **Error handling**: detects mistakes (wrong order) and reduces lives accordingly.
